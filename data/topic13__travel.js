  "A: I really enjoy traveling! Every time I go to a new place, I feel so excited and refreshed. Traveling gives me the chance to explore different cultures, meet interesting people, and learn new things. Also, when I travel, I often meet people who need help — like tourists who are lost or locals who need support. I love being able to help others in small ways. It makes the trip even more meaningful for me.",
  "B: That sounds great, but honestly, I don’t travel much. My life is really busy with work and other responsibilities. I barely have any free time, so it’s hard for me to plan a trip. However, technology helps a lot. For example, I don’t need to go to the bank anymore — I just pay everything online. It saves me time, so I can focus on my work. Maybe when I’m less busy in the future, I’ll take some time off to travel.",
  "C: I think traveling is not just about relaxing or having fun — it can also help us grow. For example, my mom always encourages me to join group activities and work in teams because it helps improve my communication and cooperation skills. When we travel in a group, we learn how to listen, share, and support each other. It teaches us responsibility and teamwork. So I believe traveling can be a good way to practice those important life skills.",
  "D: I love to travel, but for me, the biggest challenge is money. I don’t have a lot of money right now, so I can’t travel often. That’s why I’ve started saving a little bit each month. I want to plan a trip with my family someday. Even if it’s just a short trip nearby, I believe spending quality time with my family is more valuable than anything else. It’s not about where we go, but who we go with."
