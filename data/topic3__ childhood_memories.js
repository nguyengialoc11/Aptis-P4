  "A: When I was a child, I loved sitting by the fireplace listening to my grandfather's folktales. His voice brought every character to life, and those evenings always felt magical — they taught me the power of imagination. Nowadays, I share that same joy with my nieces by reading interactive storybooks on tablets. The animations and sounds make the stories more vivid and exciting for them. Still, I always take care to choose content that's suitable for their age. To me, blending old traditions with modern technology is a beautiful way to keep storytelling alive across generations.",

  "B: When I was young, I used to ride my bike around the village with my friends almost every afternoon. I can still recall the feeling of the wind brushing against my face, the excitement of racing each other, and the pure sense of freedom it brought. Those simple rides weren't just fun — they taught me what independence and adventure felt like, lessons that stayed with me as I grew up. Nowadays, it's a bit sad to see that many children spend more time indoors, glued to screens instead of exploring outside. Sometimes I find myself missing those carefree afternoons when happiness was as simple as pedaling down a dusty road. Thinking back, I realize those moments helped me develop a love for the outdoors and a lasting appreciation for friendship.",

  "C: As a kid, I could spend hours drawing animals, trees, and landscapes with my box of crayons and pencils. I loved playing with bright colors and shapes, and I always felt proud showing my drawings to my family. What started as a simple childhood hobby slowly turned into a lifelong passion. Now, I'm a graphic designer, creating digital art for various clients. Modern design tools help me bring my ideas to life with more precision, yet the creative joy I feel is just like it was back then. For me, drawing has always been a way to express myself — and it still fills my days with happiness.",

  "D: When I was growing up, I loved going on camping trips with my family in the countryside. We pitched our tents, cooked simple meals over a fire, and spent long nights gazing at the stars. Those moments made me feel deeply connected to nature and left me with unforgettable memories. Sometimes, though, rainy weather would ruin our plans, and I always felt a bit sad when we had to stay indoors. These days, my adventures have taken a different form — I enjoy visiting museums and exhibitions instead. Exploring history through artifacts and stories gives me a similar sense of curiosity and wonder, just in a quieter, more comfortable setting. To me, museums are a gentle way to travel through time and appreciate the beauty of the past."
