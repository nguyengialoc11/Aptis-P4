  "A: Before trying any extreme sport, I believe it’s absolutely essential to train properly. These kinds of activities are exciting, but they can also be dangerous if you don’t know what you’re doing. I’ve seen people get hurt because they didn’t prepare well. That’s why I always make sure to take a training course and understand the safety rules before I try anything new. With the right preparation, I think extreme sports can be a great experience.",
  "B: I’ve always been more into traditional sports like swimming, running, or playing tennis. They’re fun and easy to do regularly. But a few months ago, I went bungee jumping during a holiday, and it was an incredible experience. I didn’t expect to enjoy it so much! I still prefer regular sports for everyday fitness, but now I’m definitely more open to trying extreme sports once in a while for the adventure.",
  "C: What I love most about extreme sports is how they let me enjoy nature in a different way. Activities like rock climbing or mountain biking allow me to explore amazing places while challenging myself physically and mentally. It’s a way to disconnect from daily life and feel completely alive. If I had more time and money, I’d love to do these kinds of sports more often, especially in wild, remote areas.",
  "D: I know some people find extreme sports exciting, but for me, they’ve never been important. I actually avoid them as much as possible. I don’t like the idea of putting myself in danger just for fun. There are plenty of safer ways to stay active and enjoy life. I’d rather go for a walk or do yoga than jump out of a plane or climb a mountain. It’s just not my thing."
