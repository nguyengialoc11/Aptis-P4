  "A: When I was a teenager, I loved recording short stories on an old tape recorder with my cousins. We spent hours coming up with ideas and acting them out just for fun. These days, we make podcasts using modern apps that make editing and publishing much easier and more enjoyable. Even though technology has simplified the process, we still spend a lot of time planning each episode carefully. For me, podcasting is a creative way to express ideas and connect with people on a deeper level.",

  "B: As a child, I spent many sunny afternoons flying kites in the park with my brothers and sisters. Watching my kite rise high into the sky always filled me with happiness and excitement. Those simple yet meaningful moments taught me patience and coordination. Even now, whenever I see children flying kites, I feel warm memories returning. Those carefree days will always be some of my favorite childhood moments.",

  "C: When I was little, I was fascinated by doing jigsaw puzzles with my family. Carefully fitting each piece into place was both fun and satisfying. Now that I'm older, I often play strategy-based video games, which feel like a modern version of puzzles. They're not only entertaining but also help me stay focused and think critically. For me, these games bring the same sense of challenge and accomplishment that puzzles once did — just in a more dynamic and interactive way.",

  "D: I grew up near a beautiful lake, and swimming there with my friends was one of my favorite things to do. It was such a great way to spend time outdoors, though rainy days sometimes left me feeling bored at home. Nowadays, I practice yoga to relax and recharge after long working hours. It has helped me stay calm, balanced, and focused. Yoga has become an important part of my routine and a great way to take care of both my body and mind."
