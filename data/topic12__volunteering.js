  "A: Some people enjoy volunteering abroad, but honestly, I feel most people are more interested in travelling. I believe we should use our time more meaningfully. Each town has many people in need. Their situations are difficult, and they don’t have the means to improve their quality of life. They are individuals who have contributed a lot to the country. Sharing stories with them helps us understand the differences between generations. We can also broaden our knowledge about local history, traditions, and culture through their experiences.",
  "B: My mother told me to do local volunteering because she is part of that organisation, but I’m not into it. I prefer volunteering abroad because I can develop soft skills – something that will benefit my future career. Also, meeting new people helps me expand my network and create valuable connections I can use later in my professional life.",
  "C: I’m too busy and rarely have any free time to do anything, so spending even a few hours volunteering is difficult. I would have to take half a day off work. I see many people in need and they genuinely require some extra financial support. That’s something I can help with because I earn a good salary. Making monthly donations is not a problem for me – it's how I show my support and contribution.",
  "D: I believe there are many ways we can show kindness through volunteering. I'm retired now, and I currently help build houses for people in need. I work with a volunteering organisation that already has clear plans in place. Through this work, I’ve had the chance to experience different foreign cultures. We’re often sent to various countries to carry out these projects, so it’s also a great way to travel while doing something meaningful. The job involves manual labour, so we’re able to improve our physical health – something that some people only begin to notice after a while."
