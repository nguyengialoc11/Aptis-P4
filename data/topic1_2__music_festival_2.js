  "A: This was my first time attending the Music Festival, and to be honest, the weather really didn’t cooperate. It rained heavily on the first two days, which made it difficult to enjoy the outdoor activities. I still got wet in the tent. But I didn’t let that ruin the experience. On the final day, the skies cleared up and the performances were truly amazing — especially the final act in the evening. That last day made it all worthwhile, and I left with some great memories despite the poor weather.",
  "B: I’ve been to this festival a couple of times in the past, the quality was good the last times I came, but this time is completely different. The sound quality wasn’t great, and the whole event just felt disorganised. There weren’t enough facilities, and the staff didn’t seem prepared to handle the crowd. I couldn’t even interact with the band. I don’t think I’ll be coming back next year. It’s simply not worth the money or the time anymore.",
  "C: I really enjoyed the music of this festival and I danced to the music, I felt every second of the festival was worth it. I absolutely loved the energy of the performances, and the music was spot on throughout the weekend. However, I have to say the ticket prices were far too high, especially for students. I paid almost double what I did two years ago, and although I enjoyed the music, I’m not sure it offered good value for money. If they don’t lower the prices next year, a lot of people might skip it.",
  "D: We were playing in a band and we finished our performance in the morning. However, I stayed at the festival to meet up with some old band mates. We talked a lot. However, I didn’t like the venue. It was too crowded and not well organised. The road to the tent village was also congested. I think they should choose a better location next year."
