  "A: For me, the most important thing about extreme sports is being well-prepared. Many people think it's all about excitement and courage, but I don't see it that way. Without proper training, it's easy to get hurt or even put others at risk. I once took a rock-climbing course and spent weeks learning how to use the equipment correctly. After that, the actual climb was much more enjoyable because I felt confident. I believe training not only keeps you safe but also makes the experience more relaxed and rewarding.",

  "B: I've always preferred traditional sports like swimming and running because they help me stay healthy without being too risky. Still, I was curious about how extreme sports might feel, so I tried bungee jumping during a holiday last year. At first, I was really nervous, but once I jumped, the feeling was incredible. It was a kind of thrill I had never felt before. Even so, I still swim every week because it's safer and more practical, though I admit extreme sports can be exciting to try at least once.",

  "C: Honestly, I don't really understand why people enjoy extreme sports. They seem dangerous and unnecessary to me. I've never tried one, and I don't intend to. Some friends have invited me to go snowboarding or paragliding, but I always refuse. It's not that I dislike sports — I actually enjoy cycling and tennis — but I just don't see any reason to risk my health for a few seconds of excitement. In my opinion, extreme sports aren't essential for happiness, so I stay away from them whenever I can.",

  "D: What I love most about extreme sports is that they often take place in beautiful natural settings. Last summer, I went kayaking on a wild river, and the scenery was breathtaking. I also tried mountain biking through the forest and loved the feeling of fresh air and freedom. For me, it's not just about the sport itself but also about being surrounded by mountains, trees, and rivers. I sometimes wish I had more time and money to do these activities more often. Extreme sports give me energy and make me feel close to nature."
