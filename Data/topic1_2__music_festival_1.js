  "A: I went to the festival, but on the first day, I didn't enjoy it much. It felt a bit dull and not very exciting. Still, the stage was bright with lights and fireworks, and the overall atmosphere was unforgettable. The music lifted my mood and made me feel truly happy. Interestingly, by the final day, everything seemed different — I began to enjoy it a lot more. In the end, I was really glad I decided to go.",

  "B: I've been to this festival every year, and of course, I joined again this time. But honestly, I didn't enjoy the music, and the weather made things worse. It kept raining, turning the ground muddy and uncomfortable for everyone. After this experience, I think I won't go again next year.",

  "C: I absolutely loved the energy of the music and enjoyed every part of the program from start to finish. Although it rained a little, it didn't bother me at all. The only thing I didn't like was the expensive ticket — I spent more than I had planned. Despite that, I still had a great time and hope the organizers consider lowering the price in the future.",

  "D: I was one of the musicians performing on the first day of the festival, and I also met several familiar bands there. Even though I only played a few songs, I stayed until the event ended. The pay wasn't great, but I really enjoyed myself because I got to reconnect with friends. However, I'm still thinking about the long travel distance since the venue was quite far from the city center."
